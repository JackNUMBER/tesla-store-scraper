## Known issues

At the moment, output JSON is not well formated because it ends by `},]` instead of `}]`.
In the same way, if you stop the script during processing, the final `]` will not be added.

I know it's not ideal, but hey! the time it takes to solve it with code is much longer than the time it takes to fix it by hand a hundred times.
